# Advanced-Trivia-Game

This is a game created to ask ~silly~ trivia questions.

The quiz will ask you 5 questions, followed by a page stating whether or not you got the answer correct,
as well as the correct answer. 

This application was developed as a way to practice setInterval and setTimeout functions, as well as other HTML5,
CSS, and JavaScript skills.
